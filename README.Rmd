Most web apps intended to analyze personal health information obey a similar format:

* Enter data, often by reading a CSV file collected from a device
* Display the data, generally on a time chart
* Analyze the data somehow, often with statistics.

This is a working R package, plus instructions, that will let you quickly build an app and deploy it to the web. The emphasis is on end-to-end simplicity. Think of it as a "Hello, world" example, but the ability to load data and display it, end-to-end.

## Installation

You can install the development version of healthR 

``` r
devtools::load_all(".")
```


## Run

Run the app like this


```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(healthR)
run_app()
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/personalscience/healthR_template/blob/main/inst/img/InitialTemplate1.jpg?raw=true")
```
